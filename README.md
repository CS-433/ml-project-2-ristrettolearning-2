## About The Project

### Re producing the paper: Numerical influence of ReLU’(0) on backpropagation.

This a project for the Machine Learning course at EPFL. The reproducibility challenge.
We reproduce a part of the paper [Numerical influence of ReLU’(0) on backpropagation.](https://https://github.com/deel-ai/relu-prime)

The goals of this project are:

* Reproduce part of the paper to better understand state of the art problems in Machine Learning
* As there's already a well documented code, we will go beyond the stated results of the paper and try some other things to get better insights of the former research.

There's a  `run.py` to get started.
